## Jira Integration Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required for Jira integration:
```bash
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export JIRA_USER_EMAIL="you@company.com"
export JIRA_SITE_URL="https://company.atlassian.net"
```

### Settings File

Configure in `claude/settings.local.json`:
```json
{
  "jira": {
    "enabled": true,
    "project_key": "PROJ",
    "epic_issue_type": "Epic",
    "task_issue_type": "Story",
    "default_priority": "Medium",
    "custom_fields": {
      "github_url": "customfield_10100",
      "story_points": "customfield_10001",
      "acceptance_criteria": "customfield_10002"
    },
    "transitions": {
      "start": "Start Progress",
      "done": "Done",
      "wont_do": "Won't Do"
    }
  }
}
```

### Mode Detection

Commands automatically detect Jira mode when:
1. `settings.local.json` exists
2. Contains `jira.enabled: true`
3. Required environment variables are set

### Fallback Behavior

If Jira integration fails:
- Commands continue in GitHub-only mode
- Error is logged but not fatal
- User is notified of degraded functionality
- Local work is preserved

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with PRDs
Always begin with a well-defined PRD for clarity and alignment.

### 2. Decompose Thoughtfully
Break epics into 1-3 day tasks for optimal parallelization.

### 3. Sync Regularly
Run `issue-sync` 2-3 times daily during active development.

### 4. Use Search Effectively
Save common searches for quick access to relevant work.

### 5. Monitor Progress
Use `epic-status` and `status` commands to track team velocity.

### 6. Leverage Jira When Available
The integration provides rich project management capabilities.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
Ensure you've run `/pm:init` to set up the environment.

### GitHub Authentication
Run `gh auth login` if you see authentication errors.

### Jira Connection Issues
1. Verify API token is valid
2. Check site URL is correct
3. Ensure user has project access
4. Test with simple search first

### Sync Conflicts
Use `--force` flags when you're certain local state is correct.

### Performance Issues
1. Use specific searches
2. Enable caching
3. Limit result counts
4. Check network connectivity

---

## Command Aliases

For frequently used commands, consider shell aliases:

```bash
alias pms="/pm:status"
alias pmn="/pm:next"
alias pmsync="/pm:issue-sync"
alias pmsearch="/pm:search"
```
