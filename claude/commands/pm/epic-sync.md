# Epic Sync

Push epic and tasks to Jira, creating Epic and Story/Task issues.

## Usage
```
/pm:epic-sync <epic_name>
```

## Quick Check
1. **Epic exists:**
   - If `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md` not found: "‚ùå Epic not found"
   
2. **Tasks exist:**
   - If no `[0-9]*.md` files in epic dir: "‚ùå No tasks found. Run: /pm:epic-decompose $ARGUMENTS"

3. **Jira configured:**
   - Check if Jira is enabled in settings
   - If not configured: "‚ùå Jira integration not configured. Run: /pm:jira-init"

## Instructions

You are syncing an epic and its tasks to Jira: **Epic: $ARGUMENTS**

### 1. Read Epic and Tasks

Read `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/epic.md`:
- Extract name, status, progress
- Check if `jira:` field exists (means already synced)

Count and read all task files in the epic directory.

### 2. Create/Update Epic in Jira

**If no `jira:` field (first sync):**
- Create new Epic in Jira
- Use epic name as summary
- Set description from epic content
- Add custom fields as needed

**If `jira:` field exists (update):**
- Update existing Epic
- Sync progress percentage
- Update description if changed

### 3. Create/Update Tasks

For each task file:
- Check if task has `jira:` field
- If not, create new Story/Task in Jira:
  - Set Epic as parent
  - Use task name as summary
  - Copy acceptance criteria to description
  - Set appropriate issue type (Story/Task/Bug)
- If exists, update existing issue

### 4. Update Local Files

For each created/updated item:
- Add/update `jira:` field with issue key
- Add `last_sync:` timestamp
- Update `updated:` timestamp

Format:
```yaml
---
[existing fields]
jira: PROJ-123
last_sync: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
updated: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
---
```
