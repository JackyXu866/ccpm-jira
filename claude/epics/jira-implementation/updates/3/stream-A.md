# Stream A Progress: Epic CRUD Operations

## Current Status: COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed field mapping functions from Stream C
- [x] Reviewed jira-adapter.sh interface
- [x] Understood integration points with MCP tools
- [x] Created comprehensive jira-epic-ops.sh library with full CRUD operations
- [x] Created epic-create.sh script with CLI interface and validation
- [x] Created epic-sync.sh script with bidirectional sync capabilities
- [x] Implemented epic-specific operations (progress tracking, sub-task counting)
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling and validation
- [x] Tested integration with field mapping functions

## Implementation Progress

### Files Created/Modified
- `/claude/lib/jira-epic-ops.sh` - Core epic CRUD library (✅ COMPLETED)
- `/claude/scripts/pm/epic-create.sh` - Epic creation script (✅ COMPLETED)
- `/claude/scripts/pm/epic-sync.sh` - Epic synchronization script (✅ COMPLETED)
- `test_epic_operations.sh` - Integration test script (✅ COMPLETED)

### Key Insights
- Stream C has provided excellent field mapping functions:
  - `prepare_epic_for_jira()` - Converts CCPM epic to Jira format
  - `process_jira_epic_response()` - Converts Jira response to CCPM format
  - `validate_ccpm_epic()` - Validates epic data before operations
- jira-adapter.sh provides MCP tool wrappers ready for use
- Need to build high-level CRUD operations that combine field mapping with adapter calls

### Dependencies
- Field mapping library (claude/lib/jira-fields.sh) - COMPLETED by Stream C
- MCP adapter (claude/scripts/adapters/jira-adapter.sh) - COMPLETED by Stream B/Task 2

## Deliverables Summary
1. ✅ **jira-epic-ops.sh** - Complete epic CRUD library with 20+ functions including:
   - Create, read, update, delete operations for epics
   - Epic progress calculation and sub-task counting
   - Bidirectional sync operations (push/pull)
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Epic metadata aggregation
   
2. ✅ **epic-create.sh** - Full-featured epic creation script with:
   - CLI interface with comprehensive options
   - Validation and preview functionality
   - Integration with field mapping functions
   - Dry-run capabilities and verbose output
   
3. ✅ **epic-sync.sh** - Advanced synchronization script with:
   - Bidirectional sync (CCPM ↔ Jira)
   - Conflict resolution strategies
   - Bulk sync operations
   - Auto-detection of sync direction
   - Comprehensive sync reporting

## Blockers: None - Stream Completed

## Coordination Notes
- Using Stream C's field mapping interface as designed
- Will coordinate with other streams on shared error handling patterns
- Following established CCPM script patterns for consistency
