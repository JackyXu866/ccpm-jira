# Stream A Progress: Epic CRUD Operations

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed field mapping functions from Stream C
- [x] Reviewed jira-adapter.sh interface
- [x] Understood integration points with MCP tools

### In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Creating jira-epic-ops.sh library with core CRUD functions

### Next Tasks
- [ ] Create epic-create.sh script
- [ ] Create epic-sync.sh script
- [ ] Implement epic-specific operations

## Implementation Progress

### Files Being Created/Modified
- `/claude/lib/jira-epic-ops.sh` - Core epic CRUD library (IN PROGRESS)
- `/claude/scripts/pm/epic-create.sh` - Epic creation script (PENDING)
- `/claude/scripts/pm/epic-sync.sh` - Epic synchronization script (PENDING)

### Key Insights
- Stream C has provided excellent field mapping functions:
  - `prepare_epic_for_jira()` - Converts CCPM epic to Jira format
  - `process_jira_epic_response()` - Converts Jira response to CCPM format
  - `validate_ccpm_epic()` - Validates epic data before operations
- jira-adapter.sh provides MCP tool wrappers ready for use
- Need to build high-level CRUD operations that combine field mapping with adapter calls

### Dependencies
- Field mapping library (claude/lib/jira-fields.sh) - COMPLETED by Stream C
- MCP adapter (claude/scripts/adapters/jira-adapter.sh) - COMPLETED by Stream B/Task 2

## Next Steps
1. Complete jira-epic-ops.sh with all CRUD operations
2. Implement epic creation script
3. Implement bidirectional synchronization
4. Add epic-specific operations (progress tracking, sub-task management)
5. Test integration with existing CCPM workflow

## Blockers: None

## Coordination Notes
- Using Stream C's field mapping interface as designed
- Will coordinate with other streams on shared error handling patterns
- Following established CCPM script patterns for consistency
