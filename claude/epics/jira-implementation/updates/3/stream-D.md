# Stream D Progress: Integration & Validation

## Current Status: IN PROGRESS

### Assigned Files
- `claude/lib/jira-validation.sh` - Data integrity validation functions
- `claude/tests/integration/` - Integration test suite 
- `claude/lib/conflict-resolution.sh` - Conflict detection and resolution strategies

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed Stream D requirements from task analysis
- [x] Examined existing Stream A (Epic CRUD) completion status
- [x] Reviewed field mapping functions from Stream C (assumed complete)
- [x] Found pre-implemented validation library (jira-validation.sh)
- [x] Found pre-implemented conflict resolution library (conflict-resolution.sh) 
- [x] Found pre-implemented integration tests (crud-operations-test.sh, performance-test.sh)
- [x] Found pre-implemented validation command script (jira-validate.sh)
- [x] Created Stream D progress tracking file

### Working On
- [ ] Fix variable name inconsistencies in conflict-resolution.sh
- [ ] Fix typos in performance-test.sh
- [ ] Test integration between all stream components
- [ ] Validate complete system functionality

### Implementation Status

#### Files Analysis
1. **`claude/lib/jira-validation.sh`** (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
   - 523 lines of comprehensive validation functions
   - Epic/task consistency validation
   - Bulk validation operations
   - Field mapping validation
   - Custom fields validation
   - Epic-task relationship validation

2. **`claude/lib/conflict-resolution.sh`** (⚠️ NEEDS FIXES)
   - 724 lines of conflict detection and resolution
   - Variable name inconsistencies found (ccmp vs ccpm)
   - Complete conflict resolution strategies implemented
   - Manual, automatic, and merge resolution modes

3. **`claude/tests/integration/crud-operations-test.sh`** (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
   - 591 lines of comprehensive integration tests
   - Epic and task CRUD testing
   - Relationship validation testing
   - Bulk operations testing
   - Field mapping integration testing

4. **`claude/tests/integration/performance-test.sh`** (⚠️ NEEDS FIXES) 
   - 605 lines of performance testing
   - Variable naming issue found (scenarios vs timeout_scenarios)
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Throughput and timeout testing

5. **`claude/scripts/pm/jira-validate.sh`** (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
   - 593 lines of CLI validation tool
   - Multiple validation modes supported
   - Comprehensive command-line interface
   - Proper error handling and reporting

### Key Insights
- Stream D work is largely complete but has some bugs to fix
- Integration between streams needs to be tested
- All major deliverables have been implemented:
  - ✅ Comprehensive validation functions for data integrity
  - ✅ Conflict detection and resolution strategies  
  - ✅ Integration test suite for all CRUD operations
  - ✅ Performance testing for bulk operations
  - ✅ Documentation through CLI help and code comments

### Dependencies
- Stream A (Epic CRUD) - ✅ COMPLETED
- Stream B (Task CRUD) - Status unknown, assuming available
- Stream C (Field Mapping) - Functions referenced, assuming available
- MCP Adapter from Task #2 - Available through jira-adapter.sh

### Remaining Work
1. Fix variable name bugs in conflict-resolution.sh
2. Fix typos in performance-test.sh  
3. Test integration with other streams
4. Run integration tests to validate system
5. Commit final Stream D implementation

### Coordination Notes
- Using field mapping functions from Stream C as designed
- Integration tests validate Stream A epic operations
- Conflict resolution works with both epics and tasks
- Performance tests cover bulk operations from all streams

## Blockers: None

## Next Steps
1. Fix identified bugs in existing implementation
2. Test integration between all components
3. Run full integration test suite
4. Mark Stream D as completed
