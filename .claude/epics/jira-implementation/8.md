# Add search and query functionality

## Overview
Implement comprehensive search and query functionality using Jira's JQL (Jira Query Language), and update existing pm:search and pm:next commands to work with Jira data.

## Tasks

### JQL Integration
- [ ] Create JQL query builder/wrapper
- [ ] Implement common search patterns:
  - Issues assigned to current user
  - Issues in current project
  - Issues by status, priority, etc.
- [ ] Add JQL validation and error handling
- [ ] Create predefined query templates

### Command Updates
- [ ] Update `pm:search` command to:
  - Accept JQL queries as input
  - Provide simple search interface for non-JQL users
  - Display results in consistent format
  - Support multiple result formats (table, list, detailed)

- [ ] Update `pm:next` command to:
  - Query Jira for next available issues
  - Consider user assignment, priority, and project
  - Respect user preferences for issue selection

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Add filtering and sorting options
- [ ] Create saved search functionality
- [ ] Add fuzzy search for issue titles/descriptions

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Build query result caching system
- [ ] Implement efficient pagination handling
- [ ] Add search result formatting utilities
- [ ] Create search history tracking

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: [3] - Jira API integration for query execution
- **Can run parallel with**: [004, 005] - Configuration and workflow commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can search Jira issues using natural language or JQL
- [ ] Search results are properly formatted and useful
- [ ] Pagination works smoothly for large datasets
- [ ] Search performance is acceptable (< 2 seconds for common queries)
- [ ] pm:next intelligently suggests relevant issues

## Notes
- Focus on user experience - make JQL optional for basic users
- Consider implementing search result caching for performance
- Should integrate well with existing ccpm workflow
