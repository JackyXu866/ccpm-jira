# Update issue workflow commands

## Overview
Modify the existing issue workflow commands (issue-start, issue-sync, issue-close) to integrate with Jira, handle proper transitions and states, and update local cache with Jira data.

## Tasks

### Core Modifications
- [ ] Update `issue-start` command to:
  - Create or link to existing Jira issue
  - Set proper Jira status transitions (e.g., "To Do" â†’ "In Progress")
  - Update local issue cache with Jira data
  - Handle assignee assignment

- [ ] Update `issue-sync` command to:
  - Fetch latest data from Jira API
  - Sync status, assignee, and description changes
  - Handle conflicts between local and remote changes
  - Update local cache incrementally

- [ ] Update `issue-close` command to:
  - Transition Jira issue to "Done" or equivalent status
  - Update time tracking and resolution
  - Clean up local cache appropriately
  - Handle any required fields for closure

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Implement Jira state machine handling
- [ ] Add proper error handling for API failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for network issues
- [ ] Add validation for required Jira fields
- [ ] Update command help documentation

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: [3] - Basic Jira API integration must be complete
- **Can run parallel with**: [5] - Configuration system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing issue workflow commands work with Jira
- [ ] Proper error messages for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Local cache stays synchronized with Jira
- [ ] Commands handle offline/online mode gracefully
- [ ] All tests pass for modified commands

## Notes
- This task focuses on modifying existing commands rather than creating new ones
- Should maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Consider implementing a dry-run mode for testing
