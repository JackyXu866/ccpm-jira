# Implement Git integration

## Overview
Enhance Git integration to work seamlessly with Jira issues, including proper branch naming conventions, PR formatting, and linking between Git commits/PRs and Jira issues.

## Tasks

### Branch Management
- [ ] Implement automatic branch naming with JIRA-123 format
- [ ] Update branch creation to use Jira issue key as prefix
- [ ] Add validation to ensure branch names follow convention
- [ ] Handle branch name conflicts and provide alternatives

### Pull Request Integration
- [ ] Auto-format PR titles with Jira issue information
- [ ] Generate PR descriptions that include:
  - Link to Jira issue
  - Issue summary
  - Relevant context from Jira
- [ ] Add Jira issue key to PR metadata

### Commit Integration
- [ ] Add Jira issue keys to commit messages automatically
- [ ] Update commit templates to include Jira references
- [ ] Implement smart commit functionality (optional)

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Create Git hooks for branch naming validation
- [ ] Implement PR template generation
- [ ] Add configuration options for Git integration preferences
- [ ] Update existing Git-related commands

## Dependencies
- **Depends on**: [2] - Core Jira configuration must be set up
- **Can run parallel with**: All other tasks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New branches automatically use JIRA-KEY format
- [ ] PRs are properly formatted with Jira information
- [ ] Git integration works with existing ccpm commands
- [ ] Configuration allows users to customize Git integration behavior
- [ ] Integration doesn't break existing Git workflows

## Notes
- Should be backwards compatible with non-Jira workflows
- Consider making Git integration optional/configurable
- Focus on developer experience and automation
